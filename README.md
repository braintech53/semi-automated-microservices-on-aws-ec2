# Production-Grade Microservices Infrastructure on AWS EC2

This repository demonstrates a production-ready, horizontally scalable microservice architecture implemented on AWS EC2. The infrastructure leverages native AWS autoscaling capabilities, implements robust secrets management, and maintains strict environmental isolationâ€”all without external DevOps tooling dependencies.

The architecture prioritizes operational efficiency through strategic infrastructure decisions that optimize for modularity and cost-effectiveness.

---

## Infrastructure Objectives

This infrastructure blueprint demonstrates the implementation of a production-grade cloud architecture using AWS core services, deliberately avoiding external CI/CD and IaC tooling to showcase fundamental cloud-native principles.

Key architectural aspects:

- Independent microservice deployment and scaling mechanisms
- Secure credentials and environment management protocols
- Streamlined deployment workflow utilizing branch-based strategies
- AWS-native service orchestration minimizing external automation dependencies

---

## System Architecture

The infrastructure supports a distributed microservice ecosystem where each service operates within isolated EC2 instance groups, governed by independent scaling policies. Shared components like databases and load balancers provide centralized functionality.

### Core Components

| Component            | Implementation |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Compute Layer       | EC2 (service-specific) |
| Scaling Framework   | Auto Scaling Groups (per-service) |
| Load Distribution   | AWS ALB |
| Secrets Management  | AWS Secrets Manager |
| Environment Control | Branch-based deployment (test/stage/prod) |
| Data Layer          | MongoDB (EC2-hosted, shared) |
| Frontend Layer      | React-based admin interface |
| Process Management  | PM2 for Node.js runtime |
| Version Control     | GitHub (multi-branch strategy) |

---

## Service Architecture

| Service Component   | Functional Domain |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| `auth-service`     | Authentication and session orchestration |
| `gmail-service`    | Gmail API integration and webhook handling |
| `calendar-service` | Google Calendar synchronization |
| `reminder-service` | Scheduled task execution |
| `telegram-bot`     | Telegram webhook endpoint |
| `mcp-service`      | Message routing and tool orchestration |
| `ai-proxy-service` | AI model integration layer |
| `admin-panel`      | Administrative interface |
| `mongodb`          | Centralized data store |

Each service operates within a dedicated EC2 instance or Auto Scaling Group, with independent scaling thresholds based on service-specific metrics.

---

## Deployment Architecture

The deployment workflow follows a deterministic, branch-based strategy:

1. Code deployment paths:
   - `test` â†’ testing environment
   - `stage` â†’ staging environment
   - `main` â†’ production environment

2. Deployment protocol:
   - Controlled EC2 instance termination
   - ASG-triggered instance provisioning
   - Instance initialization sequence:
     - GitHub repository synchronization
     - Secrets Manager credential injection
     - Dependency resolution
     - PM2-managed process initialization

This architecture ensures deployment consistency and security through complete isolation of credentials.

## Security Architecture

Implemented security controls:

- Private subnet EC2 deployment
- ALB-mediated public traffic
- Restricted EC2 access patterns
- AWS Secrets Manager credential isolation
- Granular IAM role assignments
- VPC-scoped MongoDB access control

## Environment Architecture

| Branch | Environment | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `test` | Testing     | Development validation |
| `stage`| Staging     | Pre-production verification |
| `main` | Production  | Production deployment |

Each environment maintains isolated EC2 resources, Secrets Manager configurations, and ALB routing rules.
